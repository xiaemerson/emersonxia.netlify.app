 <p style="text-align:center">My name is Emerson Xia. I am 14 years old. I am a freshman at Mills High School in Millbrae, California. Currently I am enrolled in an online HTML/CSS class at the College of San Mateo. We have covered HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>

    <h2>Why I chose this class</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a child I've been intersted in technology. A few years later I found out about programming from my friend. He wanted me to enroll in this computer science class he was taking. I ended up really enjoying it and reccomended it to one of my other friends. In my freshman year my mom told me to join this other online comp. sci class at CSM. I agreed and ended up enjoying it and learning a lot. After this class I want to try and start a project on my own and see how it goes.</p>

    <h2>What I learned from this class</h2>
    <p>I ended up learning a lot from this class. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We were taught the rules and syntax for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For homework, we were assigned HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that we had to complete. This really helped me familarize myself with these languages.</p>
