 <p style="text-align:center">Hello, I am Emerson Xia. I am currently learning HTMl/CSS and Javascript.</p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Over the past couple of months I've really enjoyed learning how to building websites with HTML. I believe HTML is one of the most important languages to learn and to use. Every single website is built using HTML and people should know to code with it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS is another language we were taught in this class. Along with HTML it is also one of the most important prgramming languages. CSS was really fun to use. I got the chance to learn how to make my websites stand out more. Without CSS websites wound't have slick animations or cool 3d effects.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>Javascript was the last and hardest language we learned in this class. But even though it was one of the tougher languages, I still enjoyed coding with it. With HTML and CSS you built and designed websites. But with Javascript you can control the beahvior and content of the website.</p>
